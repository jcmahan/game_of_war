#*THE GAME OF WAR*

**War** is a super basic card game, typically played by two players who are generally five years old or less. 

**War** uses a standard playing card deck, the cards being valued from the lowly deuce on up through the mighty Ace (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A).

While this game looks simple, it is *slightly* more complicated than it seems. Trust me. 

Here's how **War** works: a deck of cards is evenly divided between two players (in this case, a player and an evil, evil *evil* computer). Each player takes the first card from their deck and throws it down, face-up, on the battlefield (AKA the computer screen upon which you're playing). On the count of three, both players reveal their respective cards, and whoever has the highest value card wins. 

Here's a screenshot:

Simple, right?

Yeah, until a tie occurs. If two cards of the same value are thrown down, we get a **War!!!**

**War** means each player sacrifices one to four cards from their deck (depending on how long the game is) and then battles again against the evil, evil *evil* computer.

The other twist is this: endess ties are disallowed in this game. If you go to **War** and the resulting hand results in *another* war, the UN steps in to resolve the conflict. Suits are then taken into the equation, Spades beating Hearts which beat Diamonds which beat Clubs. 

Gameplay continues until someone loses all their cards and wins the **total WAR**.

#*Technologies Used:* 
This browser app was built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS and a handy CSS cardset I received from my WDI instructors. 

Crucial assists during development came from coffee, Google and my WDI cohort. 

#*Getting Started:*
The game can be found at [James' Github Page](https://jcmahan.github.io/game_of_war/). 

#*Next Steps:*
In the coming months, I'm going to include a shuffle button that will allow the player to reshuffle his/her deck of cards when they're caught in an endless loop with the computer.

A graphical representation (I'm thinking either a bar graph or pie chart) indicating how much of the deck each player is currently holding and how close each is to victory will come after that.
